      <description>We have presented some example of image processing on Aurora at SC18 Exhibition. Some image processing kernels are memory bandwidth intensive because they use random memory access to access the pixels they are interested in.
Here is the performance comparison of some kernels from OpenCV.
We have also ported image processing applications to Aurora. See the panel for details.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to start the blog. We are working for SX-Aurora for a couple of years. We want to share our experience for everyone know more on SX-Aurora. We also have the github repositiry to priovide SW developed by us.
Our big brother is SX-Aurora Vector Engine blog. We have learned very much from him. You could also find useful things.
And you can visit Aurora Forum not only to get information on SX-Aurora but also to post your own article.</description>
